# Peak Male Content 🚜

**The ultimate platform for JCB and heavy machinery enthusiasts.**

Live streams from job sites, raw operator footage, real-time community, and creator monetization — built for the people who actually love big machines.

## Current Status

This is an **early-stage interactive demo** with a premium construction-themed UI. The foundation is in place and many core interactions are working, but this is still a work in progress.

**What's included in the current demo:**
- Fully interactive homepage with live streams and video grid
- Video modal with YouTube playback
- Category filtering and likes
- Responsive premium dark UI with construction aesthetic
- Clean component structure ready for expansion

**Planned / In Progress:**
- Live streaming page
- Upload system
- User profiles with earnings
- Leaderboard
- Real-time comments
- Full Next.js migration

## How to Run (Current Demo)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/drjoykarmakar/peakmalecontent.git
cd peakmalecontent
open index.html
```

Everything works offline except YouTube embeds.

> **Note:** A full Next.js version is in active development.
